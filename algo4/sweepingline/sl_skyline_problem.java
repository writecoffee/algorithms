/**
 * A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the
 * buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given
 * the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo
 * (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings
 * collectively (Figure B).
 *
 * Buildings Skyline Contour The geometric information of each building is
 * represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x
 * coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and
 * Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤
 * INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles
 * grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
 *
 * For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as:
 *
 * [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
 *
 * The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of
 * [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key
 * point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last
 * key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the
 * termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in
 * between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline
 * contour.
 *
 * For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3
 * 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range
 * [0, 10000]. The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x
 * position Li. The output list must be sorted by the x position. There must be
 * no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For
 * instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the
 * three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as
 * such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]
